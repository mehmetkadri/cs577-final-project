# Face-Off

### Background
Face-Off is a privacy-preserving framework that introduces strategic perturbations to images of the userâ€™s face to prevent it from being correctly recognized. By leveraging adversarial examples generated on faces in a black-box setting, we find that our perturbations transfer to proprietary face recognition APIs such as AWS Rekognition, Azure Face, and Face++.

### Installation
Using python version 3.5.2
```
python3.5 -m venv /path/to/new/virtual/environment
source /path/to/new/virtual/environment/bin/activate
pip install -e .
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Required weights

```

### Development
```
./scripts/create_directories.sh
```
Creates the necessary subdirectories
```
./scripts/attack.sh
```
Generates perturbations on a single image-class pair
```
./scripts/api_eval.sh
```
Feeds generated perturbations into the APIs and stores results
```
./scripts/analyze_api_results.sh
```
Reads and interprets the API scores

### API Evaluation
Note that any API evaluation requires accounts, keys, and an AWS S3 bucket. Below are some links to resources helpful for setting up keys.
